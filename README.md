# Final project

## How to submit

By mail, with the github url, the hosted url and any extra info I need to use the app (like an account or something else). I also need the list of student that worked on this project.


## For all :

- Using hook️s
- With test with testing library
- Typescript
- Authentification
- Routing (prefer [react router v6](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/releases))
- 404 page
- Loading states
- If I hit refresh, I should stay on the same page

Subject based on [the previous projects](https://univcatholille-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2020612991_lacatholille_fr/EWO1b52mlmFLjLcFhNkKjtoBwgpJMabPx9aIK1nzYTSO4w?e=2xWQ5J)

## Grading :

You will be graded based on :

- The usability of the ui
- The tests
- If the app is working (even if not all is implemented, it's still usable)

## Handout :

Demo of the app the 17 may 2021
Source code by mail for the 16 22h
